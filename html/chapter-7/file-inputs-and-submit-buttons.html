    <p>
      In this web page, I'll demonstrate how to create a file input to provide a
      tool to upload a file in a web page and how to create a submit button to
      send information collected by users to a web server. When we want to
      create file inputs, we need to use an input element with a type attribute
      with file as its value. For submit buttons, we need to use an input
      element with a type attribute with submit as its value and we can use a
      value attribute to contain a text that will appear inside the submit
      button.
