    <p>
      In this web page, I'll show to you how to prevent submition of empty form
      controls to a web server and the usage of date inputs with HTML5 date form
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously in this chapter, I started to demonstrate the usage of forms in
      HTML and how to create form controls to collect data from users. But, what
      happen when users don't provide appropriated data to be sent to the web
      server? The web will be in trouble to handle this exception. To prevent
      this problem, some web page authors and programmers implement form
      validation to each form control in browser's side of application. It can
      be implemented using some scripts in JavaScript, but web page authors can
      use form validation provided by HTML5. This resource can be used to verify
      if exists empty form controls before the submition or it can be used to
      verify if each data entered in each form control follow the patters
      expected for each data.
    </p>
    <p>
      In relation about date inputs, HTML5 provides date input form controls
      using an input element with a type attribute with date as its value.
