    <p>
      Welcome to another web page in this pratice project. Now, I'll start to
      present for you the usage of forms in HTML. Forms are used to obtain
      certain kinds of data from users. Forms are used by users to make things
      like insurance policy.
    </p>
    <h2>The process of usage of forms</h2>
    <p>
      The process starts when a user gives informations to fill in a form. The
      form will contain the each information organized by name/value pairs.
      After this, the user submits these informations in the web page in your
      browser. Next, these informations are sent to a web server that will
      receive this information. Right after, the informations will be processed
      with a programming language like JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python or C#. The
      web server could retain these informations in a database. Last but not
      least, a web page is sent from web server to user's browser to return a
      status about the process. It's a input, process, output cycle, just like
      that occurrs in a CPU.
    </p>
    <h2>Form structure and its attributes</h2>
    <p>
      To make a form in HTML, we need to use a form element to contain each
      information given by users. A form element requires an action and method
      attribute. An action attribute is used to maintain the URL to a web page
      in a web server that will responsible to continue the process with
      informations received. Also, a method attribute is used to determine how
      information will be sent to web server. Usually, it can have a value of
      get or post. A get value means the informations will be sent in the end of
      the URL in the action attribute. By other side, a post value means the
      informations will be sent using HTTP headers. A get value is recommended
      when short forms are used or when forms are used to retrieve information
      from web server. A post value is recommended when users will be able to
      upload files, send sensitive data, add or delete data operations in a
      database and when longer forms are used.
    </p>
    <h2>Single line text inputs and its attributes</h2>
    <p>
      To make a single line text input, we need to use an input element with a
      type attribute with value text. Following the principles of name/value
      pairs to send information to a web server, we need to use a name attribute
      to specify a name to text entered by to be used as name/value pair.
