    <p>
      Previously in this chapter, we start to talk about the usage of forms in
      HTML, the process of send information collected from visitors to be used
      by a web server and an introduction to usage of form and input elements in
      HTML. Now, I'll show you the usage of input element for passwords and
      textarea element multi line text input.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make password inputs we need to use an input element with a type
      attribute with value password. But, differently from single line text
      inputs, we need to use a textarea element to make multi line text inputs.
      This element works just like the input element.
