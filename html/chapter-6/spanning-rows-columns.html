    <p>
      Previously in this chapter, I started to talk about tables in HTML. Now,
      we'll dive deeper into this topic, especially about the ability to span
      rows and columns in table elements provided by HTML. In HTML, we can use
      this ability to make a table cell stretch to take a position that was
      previously destinated to another table cell. To become this possible, we
      need to use rowspan and colspan attributes to make this happen, rowspan
      when you need to stretch table cells in horizontal axis and colspan when
      you need to stretch table cells in vertical axis.
