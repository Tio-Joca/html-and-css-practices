    <p>
      In this web page, I'll present to you the usage of tables in HTML. Tables
      are used to store a set of data that contains a relation with each other
      demonstrated by rows and columns (i.e. arrays, financial indicators,
      transaction historic, statistics, etc). Each block inside a table are
      called table cell. Table cells can be one of two elements, table data or
      table heading. Table data elements are used to store each piece of data
      that sit inside a table. To indicate the respective meaning to each table
      data elements within the table, we can use table heading elements to
      indicate its respective meaning by row and column. To make a table in
      HTML, we need to use a table element with some table rows elements. Inside
      of each table row element, we can have a set of table heading and table
      data. In HTML, tables are written row by row. Also, we can use a scope
      attribute to indicate if a specific table heading was used for which axis,
      row or column.
