      Last but not least, in this example I'll demonstrate how to use another
      semantic markup elements from HTML. If you don't know about HTML's
      semantic markup, feel free to

      After several periods of college, I decided to study HTML and CSS by
      myself.
      <ins>
        But, as I was going deeper into HTML and CSS concepts, the need to put
        in practice what I've learned increases. To exercise my new knowledge, I
        developed this repo, to maintain and share my studies about HTML and
        CSS.

    <p>This is one of the <del>worst</del> best ideas I've ever had.</p>
    <h2>Strikethrough</h2>
    <p>Dell G5 5590 was <s>USD $1000</s>, now is USD $800.</p>
