    <p>
      In this webpage, I start to manipulate some semantic markup provided by
      HTML, these elements are strong, em, blockquote and q. Semantic markup
      elements are used to provide special meaning to its contents, this type of
      element is useful for tools like search engines and screen readers. Right
      down this paraghaph you can see some of these elements in action.

    <h2>Strong</h2>
    <p>
      When you look <strong>too much</strong> for an abyss, the abyss can
      destroy your self-esteem

    <h2>Emphasis</h2>
    <p>
      Before I met Gabriela, I was thinking to find a way to
      <em>comitte suicide</em>. She changed my life completely. If I can say a
      thing to a person thinking about this, find some people to share your
      things.

    <h2>Blockquote</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">
      <p>
        C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but
        when you do it blows your whole leg off
      </p>

    <h2>Quotation</h2>

      One time, Bjarne Stroustrup says
      <q cite="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">
        My best tool for efficiency and performance is abstraction
      </q>
