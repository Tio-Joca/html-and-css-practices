      <p>
        When I walk in your shoes<br />
        I understand a man confused<br />
        They much too big, but I don't care<br />
        I feel the weight your shoulders bear<br />
        Now I really empathise<br />
        Looking through your bloodshot eyes<br />
        And I know you, you're so frustrated<br />
        But we all become what we once hated<br />
        Besides, nobody can be that wise<br />
        <br />
        I can't help you if you won't help yourself (Help yourself, help
        yourself)<br />
        I can't help you if you don't help yourself (Help yourself, no, no,
        no)<br />
        You can only get so much from someone else (You can only get so much
        from me)<br />
        I can't help you if you won't help yourself (You won't help yourself)<br />
        <br />
        You got a degree in philosophy (Philosophy)<br />
        So you think you clever-er than me ('Cause you so smart)<br />
        But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)<br />
        'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been<br />
        So, what do you expect from me? (What do you want?)<br />
        To hold your head above the sea? (Keep you high and dry)<br />
        And carry you, even though you bigger<br />
        'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure?<br />
        And, anyway, we still so young (Yeah, I'm so young)<br />
        And this isn't yesterday<br />
        <br />
        I can't help you if you won't help yourself (I can't help you)<br />
        No, I can't help you if you don't help yourself (You won't help
        yourself)<br />
        You can only get so much from someone else<br />
        I can't help you if you won't help yourself<br />
        <br />
        You might be twenty-five, but in my mind<br />
        I see you at sixteen years old most the time<br />
        And I, I'm just a child and you full grown<br />
        And it was like nothing that I've ever known<br />
        You are like nothing that I ever knew<br />

        Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?<br />
        Looking for words to say<br />
        Searching but not finding understanding anywhere<br />
        We're lost in a masquerade<br />
        <br />
        Both afraid to say we're just too far away<br />
        From being close together from the start<br />
        We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way<br />
        We're lost inside this lonely game we play<br />
        <br />
        Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes<br />
        No matter how hard I try<br />
        To understand the reasons why we carry on this way<br />
        We're lost in a masquerade<br />
        <br />
        Both afraid to say we're just to far away<br />

        When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You
      </h3>
      <p>
        You know<br />
        When you say your marriage vows<br />
        They're supposed to be for real, I mean<br />
        If you think back about what you really said, you know, about honor, and
        loving and obeying until death do us part and all<br />
        But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it shouldn't be lies
        because though, it turns out to be lies<br />
        If you don't honor what you said, you've lied to God<br />
        The words should be changed<br />
        <br />
        Ooh, now as I recall, we tried a million times<br />
        Again, again and again (And that isn't all)<br />
        And that isn't all, I gave my love to you<br />
        Each time to make amends (Ooh, baby)<br />
        Suddenly, I start to realize I can't make it<br />
        Pretty birds fly away<br />
        I had to leave you for my health's sake<br />
        What to do? Make you pay<br />
        For leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever<br />
        So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again<br />
        Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you<br />
        With all my heart, as long as you want me to, baby<br />
        Ooh, if I love again, I'm gonna try a new way this time<br />
        <br />
        Memories of the things we did<br />
        Some we're proud of, some we hid<br />
        So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger<br />
        <br />
        Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby? Yeah, yeah<br />
        You say you love me with all your heart<br />
        If you ever loved me with all of your heart<br />
        You'd never take a million dollars to part<br />
        <br />
        I really tried<br />
        You know I tried, oh baby<br />
        Although we tried<br />
        All of those promises was nothin' but lies<br />
        But I really tried<br />
        You know how hard I tried, really tried<br />
        (All that rehearsing, baby)<br />
        We really lied, didn't we baby?<br />
        And on top of that, you have scandalized my name (Ooh)<br />
        <br />
        What I can't understand is if you love me<br />
        How could you turn me in to the police? (Ooh)<br />
        Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?<br />
        Best I could<br />
        You were so divine<br />
        And your love was like mellow wine<br />
        <br />
        Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime<br />
        Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine<br />
        One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again<br />
        But I'm not really bitter, babe (All the luck in the world)<br />
        I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world (All the good love
        in the world)<br />
        Good luck in the world (Ooh)<br />
        But I know you'll never be satisfied (Luck in the world)<br />
        No, you still want me standin' by your side (Good love in the world)<br />
        <br />
        Memories haunt you all the time<br />
        I will never leave your mind<br />
        Got judgment on your side<br />
        You've said bad things and you've lied<br />
        <br />
        Still, I remember some of the good things, baby<br />
        Like love after dark and picnics in parks<br />
        Those are the days I'll not forget in my life<br />
        <br />
        I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared, baby<br />
        I'd rather remember all the fun we had<br />
        All I ever really wanted was<br />
        To love you and treat you right<br />
        All we did was fuss and fight<br />
        <br />
        It don't matter baby<br />
        Take a lesson from it all (Ooh, hey, come on, come on, come on)<br />
        I never thought I'd see the day when<br />
        You'd put me through what you put me through<br />
        You tried your best<br />
        You say I gave you no rest<br />
        <br />
        When did you stop loving me?<br />
        When did I stop loving you?<br />
        When did you stop loving me?<br />
        When did I stop loving you?<br />
        <br />
        Ooh, when did you stop loving me?<br />
        When did I stop loving you?<br />
