    <p>
      Here, I will demonstraste the usage of images and its interaction with
      paragraphs. Firstly, we need to discuss about block and inline elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Block elements are HTML elements that always appear on a next line (e.g.
      paragraphs, ordered lists, list item). Inline elements are HTML elements
      that sit within block level elements and doesn't appear on a next line
      (e.g. images, links, line breaks).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to see more examples about block and inline elements, you'll
      find
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp" target="_blank">
        here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>
      But, which correlation exists between paragraphs and images elements?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Image elements that sit outside paragraphs can be displayed before or
      after paragraphs, based on image element position in relation about a
      paragraph element. If an image element is located before a paragraph
      element, the respective paragraphs will be displayed on a new line. If an
      image element is located after a paragraph element, the respective image
      will be displayed on a new line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Image elements that sit within paragraphs change which way its respective
      images content and paragraphs content are displayed, based where its image
      elements are located, in the beginning, in the middle or in the end of
      paragraphs element content.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this explanation, I will show to you some examples demonstrating the
      concepts explained above.
