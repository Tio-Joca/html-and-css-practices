    <p>
      Welcome to another practice example. In this webpage, I will show the
      usage of images with captions. Captions can be used to give context to
      images. Images elements can share the same caption element if these images
      elements sit within a figure element that contains a caption element with
      a content that will be used create the caption.

      <img
        src="../../images/chapter-5/money-bag.gif"
        width="160"
        height="160"
        alt="Money bag GIF"
        title="This is an animated GIF example, representing a money bag."

        GIF, as known as Graphics Interchange Format, is an image format created
        to provide the possibility to put frames of a picture in a sequence to
        be visualized as a animation. But, this image format can also be used to
        make inanimated pictures.
