    <p>
      In this webpage, I will demonstrate to you the use of line breaks and
      horizontal rules in HTML. As you can see,<br />
      this paragraph continues in the next line. I was possible because I used a
      br element to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, do you notice there is a line in the middle of the page?<br />
      This is known as hr element.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <a href="#top">Return to the top of the page</a>
    <hr />
    <a href="./index.html#top">Return to chapter's 2 homepage</a>
  </body>
