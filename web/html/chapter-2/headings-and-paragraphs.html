    <p>
      There was a boy<br />
      A very strange enchanted boy<br />
      They say he wandered very far, very far<br />
      Over land and sea<br />
      A little shy and sad of eye<br />
      But very wise was he<br />
      And then on day<br />
      A magic day he passed my way<br />
      And while we spoke of many things<br />
      Fools and kings<br />
      This he said to me<br />
      The greatest thing you'll ever learn<br />
      Is just to love and be loved in return
